# OpenEPCIS Community Edition

Welcome to the **Community Edition** of **OpenEPCIS** ‚Äî an open-source, container-friendly implementation of the [GS1 EPCIS 2.0](https://www.gs1.org/standards/epcis) standard. This repository provides the foundational components you need to deploy, develop, or extend a modern EPCIS repository in line with current GS1 visibility standards.

## What is EPCIS 2.0?

**EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services)** is a standard developed by GS1 to share event-based supply chain data. **Version 2.0** enhances interoperability, web-native communication, and scalability:

- ‚úÖ Native JSON/JSON-LD support
- üîÅ Better modeling of IoT, serialization, and aggregation
- üåê Seamless integration with [GS1 Digital Link](https://www.gs1.org/standards/Digital-Link/)
- üì° Event streams via RESTful APIs

---

## What is OpenEPCIS?

**OpenEPCIS** is a modern EPCIS 2.0 implementation designed for real-world usage and experimentation:

- Modular, reactive architecture using **Quarkus**
- Uses **Kafka** for scalable event pipelines
- Built-in **OpenSearch** support for fast querying
- REST API with JSON-LD and GS1-compliant semantics
- Ready-to-use with **Docker** or **Podman**
- Built-in support for event validation and profile enforcement

## Getting Started

You can run the Community Edition in two ways:

---

### Option 1: Run via Podman (recommended for pure open source experience)

#### Prerequisites

- [Podman](https://podman.io/)
- [podman-compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose)

#### Steps

```bash
# Start infrastructure
podman-compose up -d

# One-time Kafka topic setup
podman-compose --profile init run --rm kafkasetup

# Start the REST API (Community Edition)
podman-compose --profile rest-api-ce up -d

# Or run the Research Edition
podman-compose --profile rest-api-rd up -d
```

---

### Option 2: Run via Docker

#### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

#### Step-by-step

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/openepcis/epcis-repository-ce.git
cd epcis-repository-ce

# Start infrastructure: Kafka, OpenSearch, Dashboards
docker compose up -d

# One-time Kafka topic setup
docker compose --profile init run --rm kafkasetup

# Start the REST API (Community Edition)
docker compose --profile rest-api-ce up -d
```

#### Optional: Start Research Edition

```bash
docker compose --profile rest-api-rd up -d
```

---

### Option 3: Developer Mode (Quarkus)

#### Prerequisites

- Java 21+
- Apache Maven
- Docker or Podman for running Kafka + OpenSearch

#### Steps

```bash
# Start dependencies
docker compose up -d
docker compose --profile init run --rm kafkasetup

# Launch Community Edition REST API in live reload mode
cd distributions/community-edition
mvn quarkus:dev
```

---

## Sample Requests

You can test ingestion with:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/capture \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d @modules/openepcis-generated-events-capture/src/test/resources/epcisEvent.json
```

Query events with:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/events
```

---

## Dashboards

OpenEPCIS integrates seamlessly with **OpenSearch**, giving you full access to indexed EPCIS 2.0 event data for querying and visualization.

### üîé OpenSearch Dashboards

Accessible at:

üëâ [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601)

**OpenSearch Dashboards** is a powerful, built-in tool for exploring your EPCIS data:

- Filter and search raw EPCIS event documents
- Inspect the full JSON structure of events
- Build custom visualizations and dashboards
- Monitor flows, event types, and traceability patterns over time

> While we don‚Äôt ship with predefined dashboards, OpenSearch Dashboards makes it easy to create your own ‚Äî whether you're debugging, auditing, or showcasing supply chain data.

### Grafana (Optional)

Prefer **Grafana**? You can connect it to OpenSearch as a data source:

- Use the OpenSearch plugin or built-in support in recent Grafana versions
- Visualize EPCIS event trends with Grafana's rich panel system
- Combine EPCIS data with other sources (e.g., Prometheus, Jaeger) in unified views

Grafana is ideal if you're already using it in your observability stack or want high-end control over layout, alerts, and multi-source dashboards.
